    <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            This edible cookie dough recipe is egg-free and will satisfy any cravings for chocolate chip cookies without the wait. I have made this with friends before and they said that they loved the taste. So do I. The leftovers will keep in the freezer for up to 3 months.
        </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>¾ cup packed brown sugar</li>
            <li>½ cup butter</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons milk</li>
            <li>½ cup milk chocolate chips</li>
            <li>½ cup mini chocolate chips</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>To heat-treat your flour so it is safe to use: Place flour in a microwave-safe dish and cook for 1 minute and 15 seconds, stirring it every 15 seconds. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Beat sugar and butter with an electric mixer in a large bowl until creamy. Beat in vanilla extract and salt. Add heat-treated flour; mix until a crumbly dough forms. Stir in milk until dough is just combined; fold in milk chocolate chips and mini chocolate chips.</li>
        </ol>
